= Pre-Lab helpers
This folder contains tools to deploy some elements prior to doing the lab.

== Requirements
You should have this pre-installed:

* OpenShift 4.4 or more
* OpenShift Container Storage 4.4 or more
* AMQ Streams operator (tested with 1.5.3)
* OpenDataHub operator (tested with 0.8.0)
* OpenShift Serverless operator (tested with 1.8.0)

== Tools
=== ObjectStore and RGW
If you are running OpenShift on AWS, OpenShift Container Storage won't have deployed an ObjectStore and the RadosGateway needed for bucket notifications. +
You can deploy it by running: +

[bash]
----
oc apply -f 01_cephobjectstore.yaml
----

=== Deploy the toolbox
It will be used for the next step, to be able to create users.

[bash]
----
oc patch OCSInitialization ocsinit -n openshift-storage --type json --patch  '[{ "op": "replace", "path": "/spec/enableCephTools", "value": true }]'
----

=== Create a RadosGateway user
[bash]
----
oc exec -n openshift-storage `oc get pods -n openshift-storage | grep rook-ceph-tools | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'` -- radosgw-admin user create --uid="{user-name}" --display-name="{Display Name}"
----

== KNative
=== Serving and Eventing
Use the operator to deploy KNative Serving and Eventing

=== Eventing add-on
KafkaSource is not part of Eventing yet. So you must install it manually.

.Install Kafkasource
[bash]
----
oc apply -f https://github.com/knative/eventing-contrib/releases/download/v0.17.2/kafka-source.yaml
----
